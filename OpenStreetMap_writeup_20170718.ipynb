I noticed that they were just referring to part of a longer street, and that the actual addresses were just the street name without the direction (e.g. the area may be referred as 'Stenhouse Street East', but is actually part of the 'Stenhouse Street'. The street type names I wanted were 'hidden' before these directions, so I decided to get rid of these words.\n",

    "### creating new attributes\n",
    "'source' is currently part of the 'type' tag for some addresses. While this may be helpful, it's not really contributing anything to do the list. I suggest there should be a separate attribute indicating the source. This will help organize the data more, and furthermore, it would ensure verification of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formats for submitting specific sources would have to be set too, but this can be complex, as we cannot simply predict what the sources may be. Even from this data alone, we can see that some are online, some are from surveys, and some are from individual accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### abbreviation/typo/capitalization checks\n",
    "Some commonly found mistakes could be mapped before added to the dataset. It would also be helpful if a script can be created catching these unusualities and report to the user to ensure that the unusuality is not a mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Restricting certain names may work too, but there may be rare cases where those restrictions are actual names of the street address. \n",
    "\n",
    "### wrong entries\n",
    "There are some value/key/type entries that should be entered for other variables. Going back to the 'sources' type again, values such as 'garden', 'wall', 'residential' are clearly 'types' of a certain construction, rather than a value for sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at they keys, I saw some keys such as 'opening_hours' or 'collection_times' that are complimentary information regarding the said place, rather than a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were also some really absurd values. One of the 'key' groups was 'horse', and since the values are plain 'yes' and 'no', I'm only to assume that these are part of a survey question. Still, very strange values for a street data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These should be monitored regularly to maintain consistency within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may build some simple rules to allow only certain keys and values to be entered. The biggest problem, of course, would be to decide beforehand what values can be accepted, and this 'acceptable' values alone can be too much in number to manually handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### need for rigid formatting\n",
    "While most values can be freely submitted, especially if they are text values, many can be restricted in terms of formatting. For example, valid phone number within a geographic region will probably have limited number of formats used. Same can be said for other unique codes, such as postal codes or house numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may be hindered by the fact that some businesses use mobile phone number as main contact point, and mobile numbers are not region specific. And as for any rigid formatting, if there are any changes in the formatting, these rules would need to be added manually, which is not only tiresome, but if the rules were applied wrong, then the resulting data may be rigidly formatted trash data."
